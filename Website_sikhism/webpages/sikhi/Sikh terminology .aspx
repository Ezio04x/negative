    <h1>  Sikh terminology </h1><hr /><br />
        The majority of Sikh scriptures were originally written in Gurmukhī alphabet, a script standardised by Guru Angad out of Laṇḍā scripts <img src="../../images/sikhi/ikonkarcircle.jpg" img-responsive; width="150" align="right" vspace="5px" hspace="5px" />
        used in North India. Adherents of Sikhism are known as Sikhs, which means students or disciples of the Guru. The anglicized word 
        'Sikhism' is derived from the Punjabi verb Sikhi, with roots in Sikhana (to learn), and Sikhi connotes the "temporal path of learning".<br />

       Sikhism is a monistic religion and states that there is one supreme entity holding control of the entire universe. 
        This entity is referred to as Ik Onkar.


       <h3> Ik Onkar </h3><hr /><br />
        Ik Onkar (Gurmukhi: ੴ, ਇੱਕ ਓਅੰਕਾਰ; Ikk Ōankār Punjabi pronunciation: [ɪkː oəŋkaɾ]) is the symbol that represents the One Supreme Reality
         and is a central tenet of Sikh religious philosophy. Ik (ਇੱਕ) means one and only one who cannot be compared or contrasted with any other,
         (ਓਅੰਕਾਰ) is the one universal ever flowing divine melody and existential unending sound of God.<br />

        To put it simply. Ik means one. Oan is a sound. Kar means creation. This will roughly translate to The primal sound that created everything.

        The word is Oang and Kar is the unending continuation of Oang. This sound manifests in billions of galaxies and universes
        (consistent with the big bang theory which led to the creation of all galaxies) and its melody also leads to protect and preserve
         them as everything gets merged back into this sound, which has happened countless times before<br />

        It is a symbol of the unity of God in Sikhism, and is found in all religious scriptures and places such as Gurdwaras. Derived from Punjabi,
         Ik Onkār is the first phrase in the Mul Mantar referring to the existence of "one constant divine melody" which is proved by Gurbani itself
         in: "Oang aad saroopay Oang Gurmukh kiyo pasaara"ll "EKANGKAR ek dhunn ekay ekay raag alaapay॥
         Eka desi ek dikhawe eko raheya byaapay"॥, "Eko kwao kita pasao"॥ "Dhunn mei dhayn dhyan mei janeya gurmukh akath kahani"॥ "Thakur hamara sad
         bolanta"॥[4] It is found in the Gurmukhi script[5] and is consequently also part of the Sikh morning prayer, Japji Sahib. It is a combination
         of two characters, the numeral ੧, Ikk (one) and the first letter of the word Onkar (Constant taken to mean God) - which also happens to be the
         first letter of the Gurmukhī script - an ūṛā, ੳ, coupled with a specially adapted vowel symbol hōṛā, yielding ਓ.
