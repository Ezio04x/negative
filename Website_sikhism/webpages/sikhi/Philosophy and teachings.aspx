       <h1> Philosophy and teachings </h1><hr /><br />

       The basis of Sikhism lies in the teachings of Guru Nanak and his successors. The essence of Sikh teaching is summated
         by Guru Nanak's words: "Realization of Truth is higher than all else. High still is truthful living".

       Sikh teaching emphasizes the principle of equality of all humans and rejects discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, and gender.
         Sikh principles encourage living life as a householder.<br />

       Sikhism is a monistic form of monotheistic (panentheistic) religion. In Sikhism, the concept of "God" is Vāhigurū—is shapeless, timeless,
         and sightless (i.e., unable to be seen with the physical eye): niraṅkār, akaal, and alakh. The beginning of the first composition
         of Sikh scripture is the figure "1"—signifying the universality of "God". It states that "God" is omnipresent and infinite with power
         over everything, and is signified by the term Ik Onkar.[39] Sikhs believe that before creation, all that existed was "God" and "God's"
         hukam (will or order)

          <h3> The concept of God </h3>  
     God in Sikhism is known as Ik Onkar, the One Supreme Reality. or the all-pervading spirit (which is taken to mean god). This spirit has no gender
         in Sikhism, though translations may present it as masculine. It is also Akaal Purkh (beyond time and space) and Nirankar (without form).
         In addition, Nanak wrote that there are many worlds on which it has created life.

     Nanak further states that the understanding of Akaal is beyond human beings, but at the same time not wholly unknowable. Akaal is omnipresent (sarav viāpak)
         in all creation and visible everywhere to the spiritually awakened. Nanak stressed that god must be seen
         from "the inward eye", or the "heart", of a human being: devotees must meditate to progress towards enlightenment of heavenly life. Guru Nanak emphasized
         the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between god and human beings.<br />

      The Mul Mantar, the opening line of the Guru Granth Sahib and each subsequent raga, mentions Ik Oankar:<br /><hr />

      ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ॥<hr />

    Transliteration: ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) akāl(a) mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan gur(a) prasād(i).
    "There is but one all pervading spirit, and truth is its name! It exists in all creation; it does not fear; it does not hate; it is
         timeless and universal and self-existent, You will come to know it through seeking knowledge and learning!"
